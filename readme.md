# METROSTROI AUTOMATIC WAGON LIMITS SETTER [MAWLS]
###### Working title :D

## What is MAWLS?
MAWLS is automated script what sets wagon limits accordingly to the map(s) wagon limits.
This script changes **metrostroi_maxwagons** & **metrostroi_advanced_maxwagons** parameters.

As this is my first codding, the code might look very messy and not that nice to watch.
But i'm planning to rework the code later when i learn more of the coding :D
